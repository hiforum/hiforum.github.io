    presentation:
      title: "Keynote: Fundamental Principles of Software Safety Assurance"
      description: "There are many standards that either directly or indirectly address the development and assurance of safety-critical software (e.g. ISO 26262 for the automotive domain, EN 50128 for the railway domain, and DO-178B/C in the aerospace domain). There are easily observed differences in the details of these standards. For example, DO-178B uses the concept of Development Assurance Levels (DALs) to moderate the objectives of the standard according to the criticality of the software under development, whereas IEC 61508 uses the concept of Safety Integrity Levels (SILs) to make recommendations as to suitable design and assurance techniques according to the criticality of the software under development. The requirements and recommendations for SILs in IEC 61508 are not the same as those for DALs in DO-178B. However, underlying these differences there are a number of fundamental principles that can be observed in many of the current standards. Using a framework of 4+1 principles of software safety, this talk will discuss the essential features and challenges of current safety-critical software development."

      title: "Traceability Reuse for Change Impact Analysis in a Safety-critical System"
      description: "Change Impact Analysis (CIA) during software evolution of safety-critical systems is a fundamental but labor-intensive task. Several researchers have proposed tool support for CIA, but very few have been evaluated in industry. We present ImpRec, a recommendation System for Software Engineering (RSSE), tailored for CIA at a company in the automation domain. Building on research from assisted tracing using information retrieval solutions, and mining software repositories, ImpRec recommends development artifacts potentially impacted when resolving incoming issue reports. In contrast to previous work on automated CIA, our approach explicitly targets development artifacts that are not source code. We evaluate ImpRec in a two-phase industrial case study. First, we measure the correctness of ImpRec's recommendations by simulating the historical inflow of 12 years' worth of issue reports in the company. Second, we assess the utility of working with ImpRec by deploying the RSSE in two development teams. Our results suggest that ImpRec presents about 40% of the true impact among the top-10 recommendations. Furthermore, user log analysis indicates that ImpRec can support CIA in industry, and developers acknowledge the value of ImpRec in interviews. In conclusion, our findings show the potential of reusing traceability associated with developers' past activities in an RSSE. However, more research is needed on how to retrain the tool once deployed, and how to adapt processes when new tools are introduced in safety-critical contexts."

      title: "Software dependency in upstream oil and gas – challenges and opportunities"
      description: "In the years to come the oil and gas industry will experience the same challenges as we have seen in automotive and aerospace, just to mention two industries where software has become an integral part of system performance. In this talk I will try to cast some light on the situation in the oil and gas industry, primarily using drilling as functional context, and try to point at how the industry from equipment vendors to operators need to rethink their software strategies. The drop in oil price combined with more difficult resources to harvest makes the need for change even more imminent than it was a year ago."

    presentation:
      title: "Robustness of Communication Infrastructures"
      description: "Our society has become increasingly reliant on communication infrastructures ranging from the Internet to mobile networks. Understanding and accurately quantifying factors that determine the reliability of these networks are crucial to reducing odds of our society being crippled by large-scale cascading outages. These infrastructures, however, operate within a complex eco-system encompassing everything from the physical infrastructure they run on the top of to the policies regulating their operations. Communication networks often depend on each other to extend their coverage and to expand their capacity. They also depend on other infrastructures like power grid and fiber optic networks. Hence, the reliability of a communication network cannot be assessed in isolation and should be examined in a much broader context involving all interdependent infrastructures. This talk will broadly discuss the different factors that influence the reliability of communication infrastructures. In particular, it will focus and draw lessons from the ongoing efforts at the Centre for Resilient Network and Applications at Simula that aim at understanding and assessing the reliability of Mobile Broadband Networks in Norway."

      title: "Safety Demonstrations in the Nuclear Domain"
      description: "Elevated safety needs, adaptation to state of the art equipment, increasing hardware and software complexity, as well as other factors challenge the current practices in safety demonstration and justification of new or modernized nuclear power plants (NPP). Our past research, focusing mainly on the digital instrumentation and control (DI&C) systems in NPPs, explored the state of practice and the challenges in related aspects by performing elicitations with nuclear regulators and by organizing expert workshops. Differences in regulatory and industrial environments and cultures in different countries lead to wide variations in safety demonstration and justification practices. However, common challenges remain with varied perceived importance. One of the main challenges identified as utmost relevant, addressed the convincing expression and argument of safety. This presentation outlines our findings from the previous year and introduces our current work towards the development of a reasoning framework for safety demonstration."

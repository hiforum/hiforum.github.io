## How it works?

We use [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static generator in Ruby, to create a site using an easily customizable template. The hosting is done via the free [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and we link it to our own domain.

By default, we have the following sections:

* *About* - to describe what's the main goal of your event.
* *Location* - to show where it's going to happen through Google Maps.
* *Speakers* - to list information about speakers.
* *Schedule* - to show the agenda.
* *Supporters* - to show logo's of our (financial) supporters.
* *Contact* - to show contact info.

*Note that there is no integration with any registration system. We'll use Google forms.*


## Getting Started

1. Install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads), [RVM](https://rvm.io/) , [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/) if you don't have these yet.

2. Install bundler for easily managing gem dependencies: `gem install bundler`

3. Clone the repository locally: `git clone git://github.com/hiforum/hiforum.github.io.git`

4. `$cd` to the directory and run `bundle install` to install all dependencies

5. Run `jekyll server` to create a local version of the site on `localhost:4000`

## File structure

The basic structure of the project is as follows:

```

### [index.html](https://github.com/hiforum/hiforum.github.io/blob/master/index.html)

The file describing which sections to include in the main site.

### [_includes](https://github.com/hiforum/hiforum.github.io/tree/master/_includes)

### [_site/](https://github.com/hiforum/hiforum.github.io/blob/master/)

## Customization

### Basic information about the conference

Do you want to change the name, date, address, city or price of the conference? Go ahead.

```
conf:
  name: "Conference name"
  description: "Conference description"
  date: "November 15"
  price: "$100"
  address: "Boulevard Kukulcan, 30, México"
  venue: "Coco Bongo"
  city: "Cancún"
```

### Basic information about the website

Do you want to change the cover image, Google Analytics code or favicon? Go ahead!

```
site:
  theme: "yellow-swan"
  url: "http://braziljs.github.io/conf-boilerplate/"
  googleanalytics: "UA-33656081-1"
```

### Active sections

Still don't get a full schedule of the event? No problem, just comment out `schedule` line (using `#`).

Still don't get who is going to speak? Ok, just comment out `speakers` line (using `#`).

And so on.

```
sections: 
  about: true
  location: true
  speakers: true
  schedule: false
  supporters: true
  partners: false
  contact: true
]
```

You can also change order in which they appear on page and in navigation by changing order of lines here!

### Speakers List

To add/change/exclude a speaker is equally simple, just see `schedule` variable.

```
schedule: [
  name: "Chuck Norris"
  photo: "http://f.cl.ly/items/2A3p1N0C3c0n3N3R1w2B/speaker.jpg"
  bio: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo"
  company: "Delta Command"
  twitter: "littlechuck"
  presentation:
    title: "How to kill a elephant with one finger"
    description: "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo"
    time: "13h00"
]
```

Do you want to list an attribute of the speaker that is not there? Okay just add it on `docpad.js` and then show it with `<%= speaker.yourNewAttribute %>` on [speakers.html.eco](https://github.com/braziljs/conf-boilerplate/blob/master/src/partials/section/speakers.html.eco).

### List of another items on Agenda

To change the time of check-in, lunch and coffee-break, just see `schedule` variable.

```
schedule: [
  name: "Check-in / Breakfast"
  time: "9h00"
]
```

But if you want to add another coffee-creak or any kind of item on agenda, just add the item on the list.

### List of supporters/Partners

To add any supporter or partner, just use `supporters` and `partners` variables.

```
partners: [
  name: "BrazilJS"
  logo: "http://f.cl.ly/items/2N3i2W0X2f3c2g2Z2N0f/Untitled-1.png"
  url: "http://braziljs.org"
]
```

## Deploy

We don't like to centralize the power of deploy in one person, so we'll use [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) that is free. You just need to run:

```sh
$ npm run deploy
```

Wait a few minutes until GitHub send you an email telling that everything went well. Then just access: `http://yourUser.github.io/yourFork`


### How to Deploy without GitHub Pages

If you want to use your own server to host the website:

* Run `npm run generate` on the root of the project.

This command will generate a folder called `out` that contains just static files, then just upload them to your server.

## Contributing

If you want to submit a pull request, please do it in the `dev` branch.

* `master` contains the stable version of the site.
* `dev` contains features that are being developed.
